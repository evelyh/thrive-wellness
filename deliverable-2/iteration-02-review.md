## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*

We prepared for our demo according to features. Each one (or pair) of us have taken up a feature to implement, and has
prepared our own part of the demo separately. We demonstrated forget/reset password, automatic login (keep me logged in), and
a survey question after each quest. Our partner accepted the features, with a few minor changes that were addressed. 

We have learnt that being explicit in the backend admin portal is important for our partner, as they value clarity and 
they would like details to be stated clearly. We have also learnt that our design decisions will always be based on the 
users' user experience as the centre of our design decision-making process. It is important for our partner that our design
leaves users using the app at ease.
