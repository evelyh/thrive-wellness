 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Oct 28 (Thur) 16:30
 * Where: Zoom

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

1. We assigned priorities to every feature/task given by our partners as his wish and we’re currently planning to work in this order. It prevents us from running out of time to get to some essential part of this app.

2. We decided to split our task by features, not by frontend or backend because the number of team members (4) doesn’t allow us to work in the latter way, which would be much less efficient. This way, we get to finish more features.

3. We meet with our partner once a week and write agendas prior to the meeting. This way instead of doing all the work at the last minute we would be more motivated to space out the tasks to not disappoint our partner. Also, these meetings have flexibility that if there’s nothing really up that week, after discussion we’ll skip or reschedule the meeting.


#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

1. The usage of Issues and projects was not as successful as intended. After two of the members dropped from the course, we had to re-split the tasks and forgot to use the issues and projects feature in Github. 

2. The decision of incorporating the two MVPs from last year into one did not turn our as we expected. Originially we planned to start a whole new project and combine two MVPs together with their UI and structure. But for sake of time and less number of team members, we just sticked to one of them and directly work on its code base. Planning in the earlier stage turned out to be waste of time. 

#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.

1. For communication, we'll use Discord more organized with different channels for different purposes, instead of just flooding the general channel. 


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*

We prepared for our demo according to features. Each one (or pair) of us have taken up a feature to implement, and has
prepared our own part of the demo separately. We demonstrated forget/reset password, automatic login (keep me logged in), and
a survey question after each quest. Our partner accepted the features, with a few minor changes that were addressed. 

We have learnt that being explicit in the backend admin portal is important for our partner, as they value clarity and 
they would like details to be stated clearly. We have also learnt that our design decisions will always be based on the 
users' user experience as the centre of our design decision-making process. It is important for our partner that our design
leaves users using the app at ease.
